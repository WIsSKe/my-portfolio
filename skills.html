            <p>This semester, I tried to engage with diverse and authentic listening materials — from serious podcasts to sci-fi series and classic films. These resources not only helped me develop my listening comprehension, but also exposed me to different English varieties, speech speeds, and cultural contexts. Below are some of the key examples I worked with, including my reflections on their content, difficulty, and what I learned from each experience.</p>

            <p><strong>1. "The Justice of Wars, Tolstoy’s Expansion, and Trump the Golfer" — Ukrainian Accent Podcast (with David Riff)</strong><br>
            This episode focused on complex and timely questions: whether any wars can be considered “just,” how Russia managed to export cultural figures like Pushkin and Dostoevsky to the West, and what it means when places like a KGB-themed bar operate in New York during tense cold war. The conversation was deeply philosophical and historically rich, making it both fascinating and challenging. I found it difficult to understand at times due to the high-level terminology and David Riff’s muffled tone of voice. Still, I appreciated hearing such an intelligent discussion, especially during a time when war is part of everyday life in Ukraine and unfortunately this is sometimes a topic I get fixated on and can't think about anything else. It reminded me how important it is to listen to educated voices discussing difficult topics — and that I need to keep working on understanding more academic, politically charged English.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Doctor Who — Original and New Series</strong><br>
            Doctor Who is a British science fiction series that follows the adventures of the Doctor, a time-traveling alien who explores the universe and helps people using intelligence, kindness, and sometimes a bit of chaos. I’ve loved this show since childhood, so rewatching it with the goal of improving my English felt very personal. The original episodes were hard to understand because of the old sound quality and different accent patterns, while the newer episodes were more accessible but still required focus due to the British accents and sci-fi terminology. What I enjoyed most was the creativity of the stories and the language used in moral or philosophical conversations. It helped me not only understand more British English but also reflect on how stories can be used in teaching and discussion.</p>

            <p><strong>3. The Gentlemen — Film by Guy Ritchie</strong><br>
            This crime comedy film revolves around the British criminal underworld and follows a powerful marijuana kingpin trying to sell his empire while facing betrayal, blackmail, and chaos. I really enjoyed the clever storytelling, humor, and sharp characters. However, the fast-paced dialogue and heavy use of British slang made it a difficult listening experience. Many characters had strong regional accents and often spoke quickly, using idiomatic language that I wasn’t always familiar with. Despite the challenge, I found this film incredibly entertaining. It pushed me to pause and replay scenes, sometimes use subtitles, and write down new expressions — all of which helped me better understand authentic British conversational English.</p>

            <p><strong>4. 12 Angry Men — Classic Courtroom Drama</strong><br>
            This film is set entirely in a jury room where twelve men must decide the fate of a young defendant accused of murder. The entire movie is built on dialogue, persuasion, and moral reasoning. What I appreciated most was the way the characters revealed their personalities and biases through speech. Compared to modern films, the language was slower and clearer, but still formal and emotionally intense. It wasn’t hard to follow in terms of pronunciation, but I had to pay attention to the logic of the arguments and the legal vocabulary. Watching this helped me understand how English is used in structured debate and made me think about how to teach speaking strategies like giving opinions, disagreeing respectfully, and presenting arguments.</p>

            <p>These listening experiences challenged me in different ways, from decoding slang and regional accents to following complex ideas in academic and legal conversations. They also helped me connect emotionally and intellectually with the content. Going forward, I plan to keep watching English-language media with and without subtitles, take notes while listening, and try retelling what I’ve heard to improve both comprehension and speaking fluency.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mb-2">Reading</h3>
          <div class="space-y-4 border border-red-600 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/60">
            <p>This semester, I engaged with a wide range of English texts — from dystopian fiction to political articles and historical analysis. My goal was not only to improve my reading comprehension, but also to explore complex topics that interest me personally, such as global politics, war, and identity. Below are the texts I focused on, along with my reflections on each:</p>

            <p><strong>1. World News and Political Articles (Various Sources)</strong><br>
            Throughout the semester, I regularly read English-language news sources covering the war in Ukraine, international politics, and historical analysis. These included current event articles, interviews, and commentary pieces. While the general structure of journalistic writing was familiar, I found some of the political terminology and references challenging. At the same time, this reading was incredibly relevant and motivating for me as a Ukrainian. It gave me a deeper understanding of how my country is viewed abroad and helped me expand my political vocabulary and improve my ability to read more critically. I realized that understanding nuance, bias, and tone in news writing is something I still want to improve.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Five Minds by Guy Morpuss</strong><br>
            This speculative crime novel was one of the most intriguing books I read this semester. It tells the story of five people who share one body and live in a world where physical bodies are limited but digital consciousness can be extended. The mix of murder mystery and futuristic ethics made the book intellectually engaging, and I found the plot very creative and unpredictable. The challenge came from keeping track of multiple personalities and the fast-paced narrative structure. The language itself was not too complex, but the philosophical and psychological themes made me think deeply. I especially appreciated how this book showed that science fiction can still deal with very human issues like trust, identity, and betrayal — ideas I’d love to explore with future students, too.</p>

            <p><strong>3. 1984 by George Orwell</strong><br>
            This classic dystopian novel is one of my all-time favorites. I’ve read it more than once, but this time I approached it with a focus on language and interpretation. Orwell’s use of simple but powerful language makes the story accessible, but the meaning behind his words — especially concepts like Newspeak, doublethink, and thoughtcrime — offers a rich field for analysis. What I enjoyed most was how Orwell uses language as a weapon and tool of control, which feels deeply relevant today. Rereading 1984 in English reminded me of how literature can teach not just language, but critical thinking and civic awareness. It was not very hard to read in terms of language, but it required a lot of concentration to fully grasp the ideas.</p>

            <p><strong>4. On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder</strong><br>
            This short but powerful book was a perfect combination of two of my main interests: politics and history. Snyder presents twenty lessons from the twentieth century that serve as warnings for our own time. The writing is direct and accessible, but also full of references to historical events and philosophical ideas. What made it challenging was the density of meaning in such a small number of pages — every paragraph made me stop and reflect. I admired how clearly Snyder connects the past with the present, and how he uses English in a way that is both analytical and emotional. Reading this book helped me improve my academic reading skills and also inspired me to continue exploring historical nonfiction in English.</p>

            <p>These reading experiences helped me grow not just as a language learner, but also as a thinker. They encouraged me to question, analyze, and reflect on the world around me — in English. In the future, I would like to improve my reading speed and learn more academic vocabulary, especially for understanding historical and political writing. I also plan to explore more literary fiction and nonfiction that can be used later in classroom discussions or lessons.</p>
