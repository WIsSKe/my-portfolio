            <p>This semester, I tried to engage with diverse and authentic listening materials — from serious podcasts to sci-fi series and classic films. These resources not only helped me develop my listening comprehension, but also exposed me to different English varieties, speech speeds, and cultural contexts. Below are some of the key examples I worked with, including my reflections on their content, difficulty, and what I learned from each experience.</p>

            <p><strong>1. "The Justice of Wars, Tolstoy’s Expansion, and Trump the Golfer" — Ukrainian Accent Podcast (with David Riff)</strong><br>
            This episode focused on complex and timely questions: whether any wars can be considered “just,” how Russia managed to export cultural figures like Pushkin and Dostoevsky to the West, and what it means when places like a KGB-themed bar operate in New York during tense cold war. The conversation was deeply philosophical and historically rich, making it both fascinating and challenging. I found it difficult to understand at times due to the high-level terminology and David Riff’s muffled tone of voice. Still, I appreciated hearing such an intelligent discussion, especially during a time when war is part of everyday life in Ukraine and unfortunately this is sometimes a topic I get fixated on and can't think about anything else. It reminded me how important it is to listen to educated voices discussing difficult topics — and that I need to keep working on understanding more academic, politically charged English.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Doctor Who — Original and New Series</strong><br>
            Doctor Who is a British science fiction series that follows the adventures of the Doctor, a time-traveling alien who explores the universe and helps people using intelligence, kindness, and sometimes a bit of chaos. I’ve loved this show since childhood, so rewatching it with the goal of improving my English felt very personal. The original episodes were hard to understand because of the old sound quality and different accent patterns, while the newer episodes were more accessible but still required focus due to the British accents and sci-fi terminology. What I enjoyed most was the creativity of the stories and the language used in moral or philosophical conversations. It helped me not only understand more British English but also reflect on how stories can be used in teaching and discussion.</p>

            <p><strong>3. The Gentlemen — Film by Guy Ritchie</strong><br>
            This crime comedy film revolves around the British criminal underworld and follows a powerful marijuana kingpin trying to sell his empire while facing betrayal, blackmail, and chaos. I really enjoyed the clever storytelling, humor, and sharp characters. However, the fast-paced dialogue and heavy use of British slang made it a difficult listening experience. Many characters had strong regional accents and often spoke quickly, using idiomatic language that I wasn’t always familiar with. Despite the challenge, I found this film incredibly entertaining. It pushed me to pause and replay scenes, sometimes use subtitles, and write down new expressions — all of which helped me better understand authentic British conversational English.</p>

            <p><strong>4. 12 Angry Men — Classic Courtroom Drama</strong><br>
            This film is set entirely in a jury room where twelve men must decide the fate of a young defendant accused of murder. The entire movie is built on dialogue, persuasion, and moral reasoning. What I appreciated most was the way the characters revealed their personalities and biases through speech. Compared to modern films, the language was slower and clearer, but still formal and emotionally intense. It wasn’t hard to follow in terms of pronunciation, but I had to pay attention to the logic of the arguments and the legal vocabulary. Watching this helped me understand how English is used in structured debate and made me think about how to teach speaking strategies like giving opinions, disagreeing respectfully, and presenting arguments.</p>

            <p>These listening experiences challenged me in different ways, from decoding slang and regional accents to following complex ideas in academic and legal conversations. They also helped me connect emotionally and intellectually with the content. Going forward, I plan to keep watching English-language media with and without subtitles, take notes while listening, and try retelling what I’ve heard to improve both comprehension and speaking fluency.</p>

          <div class="space-y-4 border border-red-600 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/60">
            <p>This semester, I engaged with a wide range of English texts — from dystopian fiction to political articles and historical analysis. My goal was not only to improve my reading comprehension, but also to explore complex topics that interest me personally, such as global politics, war, and identity. Below are the texts I focused on, along with my reflections on each:</p>

            <p><strong>1. World News and Political Articles (Various Sources)</strong><br>
            Throughout the semester, I regularly read English-language news sources covering the war in Ukraine, international politics, and historical analysis. These included current event articles, interviews, and commentary pieces. While the general structure of journalistic writing was familiar, I found some of the political terminology and references challenging. At the same time, this reading was incredibly relevant and motivating for me as a Ukrainian. It gave me a deeper understanding of how my country is viewed abroad and helped me expand my political vocabulary and improve my ability to read more critically. I realized that understanding nuance, bias, and tone in news writing is something I still want to improve.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Five Minds by Guy Morpuss</strong><br>
            This speculative crime novel was one of the most intriguing books I read this semester. It tells the story of five people who share one body and live in a world where physical bodies are limited but digital consciousness can be extended. The mix of murder mystery and futuristic ethics made the book intellectually engaging, and I found the plot very creative and unpredictable. The challenge came from keeping track of multiple personalities and the fast-paced narrative structure. The language itself was not too complex, but the philosophical and psychological themes made me think deeply. I especially appreciated how this book showed that science fiction can still deal with very human issues like trust, identity, and betrayal — ideas I’d love to explore with future students, too.</p>

            <p><strong>3. 1984 by George Orwell</strong><br>
            This classic dystopian novel is one of my all-time favorites. I’ve read it more than once, but this time I approached it with a focus on language and interpretation. Orwell’s use of simple but powerful language makes the story accessible, but the meaning behind his words — especially concepts like Newspeak, doublethink, and thoughtcrime — offers a rich field for analysis. What I enjoyed most was how Orwell uses language as a weapon and tool of control, which feels deeply relevant today. Rereading 1984 in English reminded me of how literature can teach not just language, but critical thinking and civic awareness. It was not very hard to read in terms of language, but it required a lot of concentration to fully grasp the ideas.</p>

            <p><strong>4. On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder</strong><br>
            This short but powerful book was a perfect combination of two of my main interests: politics and history. Snyder presents twenty lessons from the twentieth century that serve as warnings for our own time. The writing is direct and accessible, but also full of references to historical events and philosophical ideas. What made it challenging was the density of meaning in such a small number of pages — every paragraph made me stop and reflect. I admired how clearly Snyder connects the past with the present, and how he uses English in a way that is both analytical and emotional. Reading this book helped me improve my academic reading skills and also inspired me to continue exploring historical nonfiction in English.</p>

            <p>These reading experiences helped me grow not just as a language learner, but also as a thinker. They encouraged me to question, analyze, and reflect on the world around me — in English. In the future, I would like to improve my reading speed and learn more academic vocabulary, especially for understanding historical and political writing. I also plan to explore more literary fiction and nonfiction that can be used later in classroom discussions or lessons.</p>

      <p><strong>1. "Human Rights in Ukraine: The Struggle for LGBTQ+ Equality amid War"</strong><br>This was one of the most in-depth and research-based texts I wrote. I focused on the legal and social challenges facing LGBTQ+ individuals in Ukraine, especially during wartime. I used multiple sources in English and tried to structure the essay using a clear academic format: introduction, development, and conclusion. One of the most challenging parts was choosing and integrating formal vocabulary and statistics while keeping the text readable. Words like “rhetoric,” “civil society,” “backlash,” and “mobilized” were difficult at first, but I learned how to use them appropriately in context. Writing this piece helped me improve my academic tone and gave me a deeper understanding of English political vocabulary. <details class="mt-2"><summary class="text-red-600 cursor-pointer hover:underline">Full text</summary><p class="mt-2">Human Rights in Ukraine: The Struggle for LGBTQ+ Equality amid War
Ongoing LGBTQ+ Rights Challenges in Wartime Ukraine
One pressing human rights issue in Ukraine today is the discrimination and lack of equality for LGBTQ+ individuals. Despite some social progress, LGBTQ+ people in Ukraine still face significant legal and societal obstacles. Same-sex relationships have no legal recognition, and there is no marriage or civil partnership available for gay couples. Protective legislation is lagging – for instance, a draft law to broaden hate crime and anti-discrimination provisions (including sexual orientation and gender identity) and a bill to introduce registered same-sex partnerships have stalled in parliament​hrw.org. Conservative politicians, backed by influential religious leaders, have blocked these reforms, with leading churches voicing strong homophobic opposition (often echoing Kremlin-style “traditional values” rhetoric)​ gay.org.ua. This leaves LGBTQ+ Ukrainians without equal family rights or explicit protection from hate crimes.
Discrimination often manifests in violence and harassment. In the first half of 2024 alone, Ukrainian rights groups documented 39 instances of homophobic or transphobic attacks in government-controlled areas​ hrw.org. (In Russian-occupied territories, the situation is even more dangerous, though underreported due to repressive conditions ​hrw.org.) Bias-motivated attacks are rarely prosecuted; according to Freedom House, police and authorities typically act on anti-LGBT violence only under intense pressure from civil society or international observers ​freedomhouse.org. Freedom in the World 2024 notes that LGBT+ people (along with other marginalized groups like the Roma) experience “significant discrimination in practice” and often struggle to obtain justice​freedomhouse.org. Indeed, Ukraine’s overall legal environment for LGBTQ+ rights remains poor – ILGA-Europe’s 2024 “Rainbow Europe” index scores Ukraine at just 19%, indicating gross inadequacies in LGBT equality measures​ rainbowmap.ilga-europe.org. This low ranking, only slightly better than notoriously anti-LGBT regimes in the region, underscores how far Ukraine falls short of full equality under the law.
At the same time, there are signs of gradual change. Public attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people have been improving, accelerated in part by the shared struggle of war. A June 2024 survey showed that over 50% of Ukrainians now support legal recognition of same-sex unions, and more than 70% agree that LGBT citizens deserve equal rights​ hrw.org. The visibility of LGBTQ soldiers fighting against Russia’s invasion has challenged old stereotypes. Activists point out that embracing LGBT equality is another way Ukraine can distinguish itself from Russia’s repressive policies​ pbs.org. Nonetheless, the community continues to face a very real risk of backlash and violence, especially from far-right and ultraconservative groups. The war’s upheaval has also made LGBTQ+ people, especially youth and those displaced, more vulnerable to homelessness and abuse.
Civil Society Action and Advocacy
Ukrainian civil society has been at the forefront of addressing LGBTQ+ rights. Numerous NGOs, human rights organizations, and grassroots groups work to protect the community and push for reforms. For example, the Nash Svit (Our World) Center monitors LGBTQ+ rights and documents hate crimes nationwide, providing crucial data that brought issues like the “39 attacks” to light ​hrw.org. Nash Svit and a coalition of human rights groups are actively campaigning for the adoption of Draft Law 5488 (to strengthen hate crime laws) and the partnership bill, including lobbying lawmakers and raising public awareness ​lgbti-consortium.org.ua​lgbti-consortium.org.ua. Another prominent group, KyivPride, has continued to organize Equality Marches and pride events despite the war. In 2023, a modest pride march was held in Kyiv under heavy security – the first such event since the full-scale invasion – symbolizing resilience and demand for dignity​gay.org.ua. Activists from KyivPride and other NGOs also provide direct support to LGBTQ+ people affected by the conflict, such as helping war-displaced queer youth with shelter and resources​gay.org.ua.
Even within the armed forces, LGBTQ Ukrainians have mobilized. In June 2024, hundreds of LGBTQ soldiers and their allies marched in Kyiv (many wearing rainbow patches on their uniforms) to highlight their service and demand equal rights from the government ​pbs.org. “We are ordinary people who are fighting on an equal footing with everyone else, but deprived of the rights that other people have,” one wounded serviceman said, calling for legal recognition of his partner ​pbs.org. Such courageous actions by civil society – from advocacy and documentation to public demonstrations – are gradually shifting public opinion and keeping pressure on officials to reform discriminatory laws.
My Role as a Ukrainian Citizen: How I Can Make a Difference
As a citizen of Ukraine, I feel a personal responsibility to support the protection of human rights—especially the right to equality for the LGBTQ+ community. Even in the midst of war, we must not postpone questions of dignity, safety, and justice. There are several concrete steps I can take right now:
Volunteering with LGBTQ+ Organizations. I can join or assist NGOs like Nash Svit, Insight, or Fulcrum UA, which provide crucial support to LGBTQ+ individuals. Whether it's helping displaced queer people find housing, organizing events, or assisting with documenting hate crimes, contributing my time or skills strengthens their capacity to make real change.
Public Education and Allyship. In my own community, I can organize discussions, film screenings, or educational events focused on LGBTQ+ rights. I can speak out against homophobic or transphobic comments—whether in person, online, or in the media. Supporting LGBTQ+ friends, colleagues, or classmates is a powerful everyday act of solidarity that helps build a more tolerant society.
Advocacy and Civic Engagement. I can contact members of the Verkhovna Rada to express support for pro-equality legislation—such as the civil partnership bill or stronger hate crime laws. I can also participate in peaceful rallies, sign petitions, and work with local initiatives that promote anti-discrimination measures in our cities and towns.
Each of these actions is not only a way to support others, but also a step toward building the kind of Ukraine I want to live in: a free, equal, and democratic country where everyone’s dignity is respected. In a time of war, our unity must include all citizens—without exception. Victory should mean not just military success, but also justice and inclusion at home.

  <p><strong>2. "Studying in Ukraine vs. Studying in the Czech Republic: My Experience"</strong><br>This comparative essay was more personal. I reflected on my experience studying in two different countries and how those systems shaped my learning. It was easier to write than the first text because I was expressing my own thoughts, but I still had to work on paragraph structure and avoiding repetition. I found it hard to choose the right connectors, such as “on the other hand,” “while,” and “however,” and I’m still working on using transitions smoothly. I’m proud of how clearly I presented my opinion, and I learned how to balance personal tone with a more structured form.

      <p class="mt-2">As someone who has studied both in Ukraine and now in the Czech Republic, I’ve had the chance to compare two different education systems. While each one has its benefits, the experience of learning, teaching style, and overall student life is quite different. In this essay, I want to share how I felt in both situations and which system worked better for me.</p>
      <p>In Ukraine, everything felt more traditional and formal. Teachers were usually strict, and there was less space for discussion or creativity. We followed the same structure for years, and most of the time, students just tried to memorize and repeat information. On the other hand, I felt more connected to people, the language, and the culture. I knew the rules, the habits, and how to behave. Studying there felt comfortable, but sometimes boring.</p>
      <p>In the Czech Republic, university feels more open. There is more freedom in choosing courses and expressing your opinion. Teachers often ask for your thoughts and encourage critical thinking. At first, it was a bit difficult to adapt, especially because of the language and cultural differences. But now I enjoy it more, because I feel like I am learning how to think, not just what to think.</p>
      <p>To sum up, both systems gave me something important. Ukraine gave me stability and strong basic knowledge, while the Czech system helped me grow as an independent thinker. I believe a mix of both would be perfect. But if I had to choose one now, I would pick the Czech system, because it gives me more opportunities for my future.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Reflection on Inclusive and Culturally Aware Teaching</strong><br>In this piece, I wrote about ideas that I want to apply in my future teaching — such as the cultural iceberg model, individual learning approaches, active learning, and avoiding cognitive bias. It was very reflective, and I enjoyed thinking about how to create a classroom where all students feel safe and understood. My biggest challenge was using more abstract vocabulary like “inclusion,” “uprooted,” and “bias.” I also struggled a bit with sentence structure, especially when trying to express complex thoughts. Still, I think this was one of the most meaningful pieces because it connects my personal beliefs with my future professional goals.
    <details class="mt-2">
      <summary class="text-red-600 cursor-pointer hover:underline">Full text</summary>
      <p class="mt-2">In my future teaching, I want to create a classroom where every student feels safe and included. The cultural iceberg idea helped me realize that culture is not just about language or food — there are deeper things like values or beliefs that we don’t always see. This will be important when I work with students from different backgrounds.</p>
      <p>I also want to use individual approaches, especially for kids who might be migrants or have learning difficulties. I now understand that being uprooted affects not just their language, but also emotions. So I’ll try to be more patient and supportive.</p>
      <p>I like the idea of active learning more than just memorizing things. That’s why I want to use the E-U-R model and also some ideas from alternative methods like Montessori. I think it’s great when students can ask questions and learn by doing, not just by listening.</p>
      <p>Finally, learning about cognitive bias showed me how easy it is to be unfair without even noticing it. I want to keep thinking about my own thinking and be more fair to every student. All these topics gave me good tools for building a more open and thoughtful classroom.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Erasmus+ Motivation Letter: "Designing & Facilitating Learning Spaces"</strong><br>This was a formal piece where I explained why I want to join an international training program. I had to write with a specific audience in mind, which made me pay close attention to tone and clarity. It was difficult to keep the right balance between being personal and sounding professional. Phrases like “facilitation,” “non-formal education,” “inclusive learning spaces,” and “contribute to rebuilding” were new to me, but I now feel more confident using them. This text also made me realize how much motivation and vision I have for the future — and how writing can help make those ideas real.

      <p class="mt-2">I am really motivated to take part in the Erasmus+ training “Designing & Facilitating Learning Spaces” because I see it as a great chance to improve my skills in facilitation and non-formal education — topics that are important for me both as a student and as a future educator.</p>
      <p>I’m currently studying English Language for Education at university, which gave me a strong interest in working with young people. I want to learn more about creative and participatory methods, not just traditional classroom teaching. This training can help me connect theory with practice and grow in a new direction.</p>
      <p>As someone from Ukraine, I also feel a personal responsibility to contribute to the future of my country. I believe that education will play a key role in rebuilding Ukraine, and I want to be part of that process. I hope to return and apply what I learn abroad to help make our education system more inclusive, modern, and student-centered.</p>
      <p>I also look forward to meeting youth workers from other countries and sharing ideas. I think learning together and trying to be a facilitator myself will be a great challenge and experience. The knowledge I get there will help me in my future work and also give something back to my community by creating better learning spaces for young people in Ukraine.</p>

    <p>This semester, I worked on improving my spoken English through exercises focused on pronunciation, intonation, and expressive reading. These activities helped me become more aware of how I speak, how emotions can be conveyed through tone and rhythm, and how important it is to stay calm and focused during speech production. Below are two examples of speaking tasks I completed, along with my reflections on what I learned from each.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Intonation and Pitch Recording Exercise</strong><br>For this task, I recorded myself reading a short text twice, focusing on intonation, pitch, and emphasis. In the first version, I read at a faster tempo, which made it difficult to pronounce long and complex words clearly. The rhythm felt rushed, and I noticed that my stress placement wasn’t always accurate. In the second version, I slowed down my speech — it was only seven seconds longer, but the improvement in clarity and pronunciation was significant. This exercise showed me how much tempo affects articulation and delivery. I also discovered that I struggle with nervousness, even when speaking at home to a computer. This anxiety affects my voice and pacing. As we say in Ukraine, “do not climb in front of your father in hell” — meaning don't rush ahead of experience. I realized I need to work on calming myself down and finding more control in my speech.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Dramatic Reading of Supertato</strong><br>This was a fun but very demanding task. I chose to do a dramatic reading of Supertato, inspired by Tom Hiddleston’s storytelling voice — “his majesty Loki, the Prince of Asgard,” as I jokingly said. While I obviously can’t match his level of performance, I tried to mimic his expressive intonation and energy. The hardest part was trying to maintain the right tempo while still showing emotion. I found that when I focused too much on acting, I lost control over pronunciation. Another challenge was reading unfamiliar words — even after reading the story several times, I still made mistakes. This made me think about how young learners might feel when they hear unfamiliar or mispronounced words. It showed me the importance of being well-prepared and confident when reading aloud to children so that they feel safe and engaged rather than confused or nervous.</p>

    <p>These speaking experiences taught me that effective communication is not only about correct pronunciation, but also about emotional control, rhythm, and audience awareness. I need to continue working on speaking calmly, improving my expressive range, and preparing better when reading aloud. I also want to explore more dramatic reading techniques and classroom storytelling strategies to make my future lessons more engaging. Speaking remains a skill I’m still developing, but these tasks gave me valuable insights and confidence to keep going.</p>
