            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mb-1">Writing</h3>
            <p>What I’m already doing is taking an online English course where I write short essays every week. My goal now is to focus more on the structure, tone, and clarity of what I write. I want to write at least one extra piece every two weeks (like a reflection, feedback, or lesson idea) and try to improve how I organize my thoughts. By the end of the semester, I want to feel more confident writing texts that are clear, useful, and connected to teaching.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mb-1">Reading</h3>
            <p>I’ve started changing all of my interfaces — like games and my operating system — into English. I also read many articles and news in English almost every day. My goal is to keep doing this regularly and also try to notice how texts are structured or how language is used. I want to collect at least 4–5 texts that I could use or adapt in my own teaching in the future. These could be useful examples for my portfolio or lesson plans.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mb-1">Listening</h3>
            <p>I want to improve my listening by using real-life English — like podcasts, YouTube interviews, or lectures. My plan is to listen to something at least three times a week and practise writing short notes. I’ll focus on understanding natural speech, different accents, and useful expressions. I also want to create one listening task by the end of the semester using something I found interesting.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mb-1">Speaking</h3>
            <p>I want to speak more English outside class, especially through my hobbies. For example, I’ll try to use English in voice chats when playing online games — at least once or twice a week. I also want to make two new English-speaking friends this semester and talk with them regularly. This will help me get more fluent and comfortable in real conversations.</p>
