      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Final Self-Assessment</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">It’s been a valuable period of growth in all areas of English. By working on a wide range of tasks, I was able to identify my strengths, reflect on challenges, and understand better how I learn. Below is my self-assessment divided into the four main language skills, along with a comparison of where I started and where I am now:</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-6 mb-2">Reading</h3>
      <p class="mb-2">Reading remains one of my stronger skills, especially because I enjoy literature and have enjoyed it through my whole life. I ‘ve read a variety of texts this semester — from dystopian novels like 1984 and Five Minds to political news articles and academic essays. These helped me expand my vocabulary and improve my ability to analyze complex ideas in English. I sometimes struggled with understanding abstract or academic expressions, especially in political and historical writing, such as “geopolitical leverage” or “civil resistance.” However, the challenge was helpful, and I feel that I’ve become more confident reading longer and more advanced texts. I would like to continue working on my reading speed and learn how to take better notes while reading academic materials.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-6 mb-2">Listening</h3>
      <p class="mb-2">This skill has improved noticeably thanks to regular practice with real-world materials. I listened to podcasts, news segments, and British series and films. I’m proud of the fact that I’ve become better at understanding various accents — especially British — and I can now follow fast speech more easily than before. However, I still struggle with informal language, regional slang, and muffled speech, especially in movies like The Gentlemen or in podcast interviews with unclear audio. To improve, I plan to continue listening without subtitles and to try summarizing or discussing what I’ve heard. Listening to different voices and topics helped me connect language learning with current world events and topics I care about.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-6 mb-2">Speaking</h3>
      <p class="mb-2">Speaking is the area where I still feel the most insecure, even though I made noticeable progress this semester. Through intonation and dramatic reading tasks, I realized how important tempo, pitch, and emotional control are. Recording myself helped me identify problems like rushing through long words or losing clarity when I get nervous. One unexpected challenge was how easily I become anxious even when speaking alone. I also struggled with unfamiliar words during reading aloud exercises — even after practicing several times. Still, these experiences helped me grow. I now know how much better my pronunciation becomes when I slow down and breathe. In the future, I want to focus on building confidence, expanding my spoken vocabulary, and practicing clear and expressive communication, especially for classroom situations.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-6 mb-2">Writing</h3>
      <p class="mb-2">Writing was probably my biggest area of growth this semester. I worked on academic texts, personal reflections, and even a motivation letter — and with each one, I learned more about how to express myself in English. I became more comfortable using formal vocabulary and connecting complex ideas, and I now know how to structure longer pieces more effectively. I still struggle with some grammar points and sentence flow, especially when trying to avoid repetition or using transitions like “however,” “on the other hand,” and “moreover.” One of my favorite writing experiences was the LGBTQ+ rights essay, because it allowed me to combine research, formal writing, and personal voice. Overall, I’m proud of my progress and want to continue improving my editing and self-correction skills.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-600 mt-6 mb-2">Future Goals</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-2">
