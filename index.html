        <p>My name is Mykhail Poddenezhnyi, and I come from Kyiv, Ukraine. English has been a part of my life since early childhood — I started learning it when I was around six years old. What began as a simple exposure has gradually turned into a lifelong journey of development, exploration, and passion. In today’s rapidly globalizing world, I believe English is not just a language, but a powerful tool that connects people, cultures, and opportunities. This belief led me to choose the English Language for Education program at university, aiming to build a meaningful career around both learning and teaching the language.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">As someone growing up in a country undergoing European integration, I have come to see English as a bridge — one that opens doors to international communication, education, and collaboration. I have already had the chance to assist my English teacher at my local school and help friends prepare for exams. These experiences sparked a deeper interest in teaching and made me realize how rewarding it is to help others grow.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Outside of academics, I am an avid reader, especially fond of dystopian literature, though I enjoy stories of all kinds. I speak Ukrainian, Czech, and English fluently, and I can understand most Slavic languages. I’m still discovering and refining my own learning and teaching styles, but I see this portfolio as a great opportunity to reflect on that process and track my progress.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">This language portfolio is not just a requirement — it is a personal record of how far I’ve come and a stepping stone to where I hope to go as a future educator.</p>
